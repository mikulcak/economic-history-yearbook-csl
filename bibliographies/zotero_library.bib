	abstract = {Virtual Prototypes (VPs) provide an early development platform to embedded software designers when the hardware is not ready yet and allows them to explore the design space of a system, both from the software and architecture perspective. However, automatic generation of VPs is not straightforward because several aspects such as the validity of the generated platforms and the timing of the components needs to be considered. To address this problem, based on a framework which characterizes predictable platform templates, we propose a method for automated generation of VPs which is integrated into a combined design flow consisting of analytic and simulation based design-space exploration. Using our approach the valid TLM-2.0-based simulated VP instances with timing annotation can be generated automatically and used for further development of the system in the design flow. We have demonstrated the potential of our method by designing a JPEG encoder system.},

Building on a historical account of how competition and the credit system have forced actors to orient their decisions towards a future that is portrayed and perceived as offering both limitless opportunities and immeasurable risks, Beckert shows how the uncertainty inherent in the future pressures actors to form expectations of distinct outcomes and prevents them from calculating optimal decisions. But how do actors make decisions in a world that contains such fundamental uncertainty? Beckert argues that decisions in the economy are based on imaginaries of the future, which he calls fictional expectations, which allow us to act as if we know the future, providing the reassurance needed to embrace endeavors whose outcomes are unknowable. Beckert shows how these fictional expectations are the underlying force that propels the economy, from investments and the operation of the monetary system to innovations and the purchase of new consumer goods, and how economic crises ensue when these fictional expectations collapse. With its focus on the role of expectations in the economy, Imagined Futures addresses the central macro-level question in the history of the social sciences: What are the sources of the epic growth and repeated crises in modern capitalism?"--Provided by publisher},

Chapters on economics, human geography, political science, psychology, social anthropology, and sociology will interest anyone wanting short, accessible histories of those disciplines, all written by experts in the relevant field; they will also make it easy for readers to make comparisons between disciplines. A final chapter proposes a blueprint for a history of the social sciences as a whole. Whereas most of the existing literature considers the social sciences in isolation from one other, this volume shows that they have much in common; for example, they have responded to common problems using overlapping methods, and cross-disciplinary activities have been widespread. The focus throughout the book is on societal pressures on knowledge production rather than just theoretical lineages. This book is noteworthy because it: Is the first book that puts together histories of the main social sciences since World War II, each written by a discipline specialist; Enables the readers to realize that what they see as specific to their own discipline is in fact common to several; Contains a chapter that proposes a blueprint for a history of the social sciences as a whole"--},

In this gripping biography, Jeremy Adelman tells the story of a man shaped by modern horrors and hopes, a worldly intellectual who fought for and wrote in defense of the values of tolerance and change. Born in Berlin in 1915, Hirschman grew up amid the promise and turmoil of the Weimar era, but fled Germany when the Nazis seized power in 1933. Amid hardship and personal tragedy, he volunteered to fight against the fascists in Spain and helped many of Europe's leading artists and intellectuals escape to America after France fell to Hitler. His intellectual career led him to Paris, London, and Trieste, and to academic appointments at Columbia, Harvard, and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He was an influential adviser to governments in the United States, Latin America, and Europe, as well as major foundations and the World Bank. Along the way, he wrote some of the most innovative and important books in economics, the social sciences, and the history of ideas. Throughout, he remained committed to his belief that reform is possible, even in the darkest of times. This is the first major account of Hirschman's remarkable life, and a tale of the twentieth century as seen through the story of an astute and passionate observer. Adelman's riveting narrative traces how Hirschman's personal experiences shaped his unique intellectual perspective, and how his enduring legacy is one of hope, open-mindedness, and practical idealism},

	abstract = {The economics profession in twentieth-century America began as a humble quest to understand the "wealth of nations." It grew into a profession of immense public prestige--and now suffers a strangely withered public purpose. Michael Bernstein portrays a profession that has ended up repudiating the state that nurtured it, ignoring distributive justice, and disproportionately privileging private desires in the study of economic life. Intellectual introversion has robbed it, he contends, of the very public influence it coveted and cultivated for so long. With wit and irony he examines how a community of experts now identified with uncritical celebration of ''free market'' virtues was itself shaped, dramatically so, by government and collective action. In arresting and provocative detail Bernstein describes economists' fitful efforts to sway a state apparatus where values and goals could seldom remain separate from means and technique, and how their vocation was ultimately humbled by government itself. Replete with novel research findings, his work also analyzes the historical peculiarities that led the profession to a key role in the contemporary backlash against federal initiatives dating from the 1930s to reform the nation's economic and social life. Interestingly enough, scholars have largely overlooked the history that has shaped this profession. An economist by training, Bernstein brings a historian's sensibilities to his narrative, utilizing extensive archival research to reveal unspoken presumptions that, through the agency of economists themselves, have come to mold and define, and sometimes actually deform, public discourse. This book offers important, even troubling insights to readers interested in the modern economic and political history of the United States and perplexed by recent trends in public policy debate. It also complements a growing literature on the history of the social sciences. Sure to have a lasting impact on its field.},

In addition to nervous tissue, primate placenta is the only other animal source which contains appreciable acetylcholine and its biosynthetic enzyme. Human brain caudate nucleus and human placental choline acetyltransferase were purified to electrophoretic homogeneity using ion-exchange and blue dextran-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The molecular weights determined by Sephadex G-150 gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis are 67000 plus or minus 3000. N-Ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, and dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) inhibit the enzyme. Dithiothreitol reverses the inhibition produced by the latter two reagents. The pKa of the group associated with N-ethylmaleimide inhibition is 8.6 plus or minus 0.3. A chemically competent acetyl-thioenzyme is isolable by Sephadex gel filtration. The enzymes from the brain and placenta are thus far physically and biochemically indistinguishable.},

One way, this essay suggests, is to structure case studies around the activities or issues that are common to knowledge production generally: for example, issues of common practices, role and identity, credibility and trust, fairness in participation and reward, and translocal circulation. Such studies would be particular and local yet transcend the singularities of period, place, and discipline. They would facilitate productive contest over the general meaning of science in its diversely varied forms.},

	volume = {85},
	issn = {0007-1188},
	abstract = {The response of the bovine retractor penis (BRP) to stimulation of non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) inhibitory nerves and to an inhibitory extract prepared from this muscle have been studied using intracellular microelectrode, sucrose gap and conventional mechanical recording techniques. Both inhibitory nerve stimulation and inhibitory extract hyperpolarized the membrane potential and relaxed spontaneous or guanethidine (3 X 10(-5) M)-induced tone. These effects were accompanied by an increase in membrane resistance. Following membrane potential displacement from an average value of -53 +/- 7 mV (n = 184; Byrne \& Muir, 1984) inhibitory potentials to nerve stimulation were abolished at approximately -30 mV; there was no evidence of reversal. Displacement by inward hyperpolarizing current over the range -45 to -60 mV increased the inhibitory response to nerve stimulation and to inhibitory extract; at more negative potential values (above approximately -60 mV) the inhibitory potential decreased and was abolished (approximately -103 mV). There was no evidence of reversal. Removal of [K+]o reversibly reduced hyperpolarization to nerve stimulation and inhibitory extract. No enhancement was observed. Increasing the [K+]o to 20 mM reduced the inhibitory potential to nerve stimulation but this was restored by passive membrane hyperpolarization. Inhibitory potentials were obtained at membrane potential values exceeding that of the estimated EK (-49 mV). [Cl-]o-free or [Cl-]o-deficient solutions reduced and abolished (after some 20-25 min) the hyperpolarization produced by inhibitory nerve stimulation or inhibitory extract. The inhibitory potential amplitude following nerve stimulation was not restored by passive displacement of the membrane potential from -26 to -104 mV approximately. Ouabain (1-5 X 10(-5) M) reduced then (45-60 min later) abolished the inhibitory potential to nerve stimulation. The effects of this drug on the extract were not investigated. It is concluded that the inhibitory response to nerve stimulation and extract in the BRP may involve several ionic species. However, unlike that in gastrointestinal muscles the NANC response in the BRP is accompanied by an increased membrane resistance and does not primarily involve K+. The underlying mechanisms for the inhibitory response to both NANC nerve stimulation and inhibitory extract appear to be similar, compatible with the view that the latter may contain the inhibitory transmitter released from these nerves in this tissue.},

Diese Situation hat nicht nur ihre Ergebnisse beeinflu{\ss}t, sondern zugleich einen Wechsel der Problematik bewirkt: urspr{\"u}nglich war die Arbeit geplant als ein Vergleich zwischen marxistischer Krisentheorie und den soziologischen Anomie-Konzepten. Diese Problematik weitete sich jedoch aus zu einer Untersuchung des Krisenbegriffs, die die in ihm angelegte Wahrnehmungsperspektive zum Gegenstand werden lie{\ss}- und damit die Zeitstruktur des modernen Gesellschaftsdenkens. Diese Konsequenz dr{\"a}ngte sich, neben N{\"o}tigungen des bearbeiteten Materials, aufgrund der mit dem Ende des Realsozialismus so grundle gend ver{\"a}nderten Erfahrungslage auf. Der "Weltb{\"u}rgerkrieg", dessen Front in Deutschland als Grenze zwischen zwei konkurrierenden Gesell schaftsmodellen verlief, -versteinerte eine intellektuelle Konstellation, die den Zerfallsproze{\ss} der Hegeischen Geschichtsphilosophie wiederholte. In der Konfrontation von Gesellschaftsordnungen, die gegen{\"u}ber ihrem Antagonisten jeweils die Vernunft zu verk{\"o}rpern beanspruchten, erhielt sich eine geschichtsphilosophische Disposition, die den Gegensatz von Rechts- und Linkshegelianismus reproduzierte. Die marxistisch-leninisti schen Erben des Linkshegelianismus, deren Staat die geschichtliche Zu kunft verk{\"o}rpern sollte, erhoben eine Geschichtsteleologie zur Staatsre ligion, die das eigene Staatswesen zur Inkarnation eines sozialen Jenseits verkl{\"a}rte, in welchem der Weg zur erf{\"u}llten Geschichte schon endg{\"u}ltig gebahnt schien. Auf der Gegenseite erkl{\"a}rte vor allem die Intellektuel lengruppe, deren Versuch, in der "Konservativen Revolution" der Ge schichte eine Wende zu geben, mit dem Engagement f{\"u}r den National sozialismus diskreditiert war, nunmehr das Ende der Geschichte.},

	shorttitle = {The global transformation of time},
	abstract = {"This book is a revisionist account of attempts to unify clock times, calendars, and social time, and a methodological intervention in discussions about writing global and transnational history. The book uses the reform of time between 1870 and 1950 as a lens through which to understand the dynamics of globalization. Based on research in archives around the world in multiple languages, individual chapters take the story of uniform time to France and Germany, Britain, the British Empire/German colonies/Latin America, British India, Arab elites in the Levant, Muslim scholars in Egypt, and to the League of Nations. The author shows how cross-border flows of ideas and concepts of uniform time resulted in a nationalization and regionalization of temporal identities. As a consequence, uniform, accurate clock time remained nonstandardized, unstable, and incomplete as late as the 1930s and 1940s. Calendar reform, just as vivid and vast a field of activism as clock time, never came to pass altogether due to strong national and religious objections to a uniform World Calendar. When ideas about uniform time moved across borders and continents, they often did so along lateral, informal trajectories of transmission. Local initiatives often preceded national time politics. Top-down attempts to devise time reform schemes at international conferences, to implement them nationally, and assure application in the most remote local contexts rarely succeeded. Rather, globalization disheveled such hierarchies of the international, the national, and the local. The book, then, emphasizes the importance of nationalism and states as well as attention to scale in writing the history of global flows and connections"--},

	abstract = {This article juxtaposes dogmatics and deconstruction to argue that the latter is no more than an inverted or decomposed species of the former. Taking the contemporary attraction of law to other disciplines as her starting point, Vismann traces the history of linguist interest in law. Focussing on Derrida{\textquoteright}s exemplary and essentially glossatorial analyses of legal textuality, and of the paradoxes and aporias of legal language, she argues that deconstruction offers few surprises to lawyers long trained in the philological ironies of power. A more constructive understanding of the conjunction of dogmatics and deconstruction would thus look to the role of law as a science of transfer from the real to the symbolic and would in this vein focus on the hardware of legal acts of transfer, such as filing systems and thus propose a prehistory of cyber legality.},

	abstract = {"The period leading up to the Great Depression witnessed the rise of the economic forecasters, pioneers who sought to use the tools of science to predict the future, with the aim of profiting from their forecasts. This book chronicles the lives and careers of the men who defined this first wave of economic fortune tellers, men such as Roger Babson, Irving Fisher, John Moody, C. J. Bullock, and Warren Persons. They competed to sell their distinctive methods of prediction to investors and businesses, and thrived in the boom years that followed World War I. Yet, almost to a man, they failed to predict the devastating crash of 1929.Walter Friedman paints vivid portraits of entrepreneurs who shared a belief that the rational world of numbers and reason could tame--or at least foresee--the irrational gyrations of the market. Despite their failures, this first generation of economic forecasters helped to make the prediction of economic trends a central economic activity, and shed light on the mechanics of financial markets by providing a range of statistics and information about individual firms. They also raised questions that are still relevant today. What is science and what is merely guesswork in forecasting? What motivates people to buy forecasts? Does the act of forecasting set in motion unforeseen events that can counteract the forecast made? Masterful and compelling, Fortune Tellers highlights the risk and uncertainty that are inherent to capitalism itself"--},

@article{zurawski_conformational_1975,
	title = {Conformational properties of bovine plasma albumin with a cleaved internal peptide bond},
	volume = {14},
	issn = {0006-2960},
	abstract = {As shown previously, proteinases frequently associated with plasma albumin samples catalyze a very limited and specific cleavage of the albumin molecule when it exists in the F conformational state near pH 3.7. The primary proteolytic product, BPA, has a molecular weight similar to or identical with that of the parent protein but yields two large fragments of molecular weight approximately 46000 and 23000 on reduction. Evidence is presented here that cleavage occurs within the disulfide loop between Cys390 and Cys434 with no detectable loss of small peptides, the amino acid composition of BPA being identical with that of the parent protein within experimental error. Cleavage exposes a new amino-terminal phenylalanine residue and may occur at the Glx392-Phe393 bond although the possibility exists that it occurs at another X-Phe bond in the unsequenced region of residues 400-402. The damaged protein has a somewhat altered secondary structure as judged from optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism measurements, probably an approximate 15\% loss in helicity. The hydrodynamic volume is increased by approximately 20\%. However, various physical studies indicate the tertiary structure to be strikingly similar to that of the native protein. Of most significance is the fact that the protein still undergoes the N-F and N-B transitions, although in both cases they occur at somewhat more moderate pH than in the parent protein. Moreover a sensitivity of the N-B transition to Ca2+ is still seen and binding behavior toward the dye 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid is essentially unaltered. The results are best understood in terms of the concept of a multidomain structure which has been suggested frequently for plasma ablumin. Bond cleavage damages one domain but leaves the overall structure essentially unaltered except for some weakening of the interaction between domains.},

	abstract = {This essay deals with the ambiguous and contradictory relationship between labour, consumption and individuality in modern mass culture. This relationship has been conceptualised rather differently in American and European visions of individuality. In recent years, the long-lasting tradition of European (and especially German) scepticism towards the consumer society, which was nourished by conservative, (neo) liberal and Marxist influences, has retreated in favour of a more general acceptance of modern consumerism. While labour has not been replaced as the most important means of economic and cultural participation, the social construction of personal individuality is seen to take place through an ever-increasing multitude of means of consumption. The article analyses this profound process of cultural change and at the same time reflects upon the opportunities and limits of the current scholarly paradigm concerning the consumer society. Le sujet de cette \&\#xe9;tude est la relation ambigu\&\#xeb; et contradictoire entre le travail, la consommation et l'individualit\&\#xe9; dans la culture moderne de masse: relation qui se conceptualise diff\&\#xe9;remment dans les visions am\&\#xe9;ricaine et europ\&\#xe9;enne de l'individualit\&\#xe9;. Dans les ann\&\#xe9;es r\&\#xe9;centes, le scepticisme traditionnel des Europ\&\#xe9;ens (et surtout des Allemands) en ce qui concerne la soci\&\#xe9;t\&\#xe9; de consommation, nourri par des influences conservatrices, (n\&\#xe9;o) lib\&\#xe9;rales et marxistes, a d\&\#xfb; c\&\#xe9;der devant l'acceptation g\&\#xe9;n\&\#xe9;rale du consum\&\#xe9;risme moderne. Sans que le travail ait perdu sa place comme la grande clef de participation \&\#xe9;conomique et culturelle, la construction sociale de l'individu peut maintenant se baser sur une multitude toujours croissante de moyens de consommation. L'article se fonde sur ce processus de changement culturel profond et en m\&\#xea;me temps, contemple les possibilit\&\#xe9;s et les limitations du paradigme construit par les chercheurs contemporains pour repr\&\#xe9;senter la soci\&\#xe9;t\&\#xe9; de consommation. Gegenstand dieses Artikels ist der vieldeutig-widerspr\&\#xfc;chliche Zusammenhang zwischen Arbeit, Konsum und Individualit\&\#xe4;t in der modernen Massenkultur, der sich Europa und in den USA in jeweils unterschiedlicher Weise konzeptualisiert wurde. Die kontinentaleurop\&\#xe4;ische und insbesondere deutsche Tradition war lange Zeit von einem tiefgreifenden, kulturpessimistisch grundierten Skeptizismus gegen\&\#xfc;ber der Konsumgesellschaft charakterisiert, der sich sowohl aus b\&\#xfc;rgerlich-konservativen wie aus marxistischen Wurzeln speiste. In den letzten Jahrzehnten ist dieser Skeptizismus zugunsten einer weitgehenden Akzeptanz des modernen consumerism zur\&\#xfc;ckgetreten. Obwohl die Erwerbsarbeit noch immer das entscheidende Eingangstor zur kulturellen Partizipation bildet, vollzieht sich die soziale Konstruktion von Individualit\&\#xe4;t doch immer st\&\#xe4;rker durch eine stetig zunehmende Vielfalt von Konsumm\&\#xf6;glichkeiten. Der Beitrag analysiert diese tiefgreifende kulturelle Ver\&\#xe4;nderung und verkn\&\#xfc;pft sie mit \&\#xdc;berlegungen zu den M\&\#xf6;glichkeiten und Grenzen des in der Forschung aktuellen Paradigmas der Konsumgesellschaft.},
